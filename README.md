# Intro & Motivation

This repository contains informations about the [Godot Game Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

Sometimes, there's info on the Engine that currently has no place on the official github repositories or the web page, e.g. documentation on unexposed classes or too technical information.

My personal interest lies in 3D, so that will be my main focus. If you want to share about 2D, please see the CONTRIBUTING guidelines and open an issue or pull request!


# Disclaimer

The information in this reposotory may be partially or completely incorrect. Some info is from hearing, vague memory or reading and misunderstanding code. In case you find a mistake, you can open an Issue and state corrections (with source that backs your claim).


# Godot 4

â€¦ is currently in the Alpha version available. Personally, I expect the Beta version coming in October 2022 and the official stable version in mid 2023. Time will tell!

Initially, it was only about a new renderer (Vulkan), but feedback made clear that a fundamental change was in order ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/on0hzn/comment/h5pgoi5/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). Therefore, Godot 4 is mostly a complete code/system restructure, to allow more modern features to be implemented more easily and consequently more quickly.  
Fundamental changes always break compatibility with a previous version. So, identifying desired new features (and changes of existing ones) helps with deciding on the target architecture. Thus, adding as many needed compatibility breaking changes in one fell swoop is strongly desired. And because changing the code structure always takes a long time, new features find their way in. Which in turn makes Godot 4 also more feature rich.  
To make things easier for existing projects, there's a converter tool in the making, helping developers to migrate their projects from Godot 3 to 4.
