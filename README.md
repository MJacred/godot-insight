# Intro & Motivation

This repository contains informations about the [Godot Game Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

Sometimes, there's info on the Engine that currently has no place on the official github repositories or the web page, e.g. documentation on unexposed classes or too technical information.

My personal interest lies in 3D, so that will be my main focus. If you want to share about 2D, please see the CONTRIBUTING guidelines and open an issue or pull request!


# Disclaimer

The information in this reposotory may be partially or completely incorrect. Some info is from hearing, vague memory or reading and misunderstanding code. In case you find a mistake, you can open an Issue and state corrections (with source that backs your claim).


# Godot 4

â€¦ is currently in the Alpha version available. Personally, I expect the Beta version coming in October 2022 and the official stable version in mid 2023. Time will tell!

Initially, it was only about a new renderer (Vulkan), but feedback made clear that a fundamental change was in order. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/on0hzn/comment/h5pgoi5/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).  
Therefore, Godot 4 is mostly a complete code/system restructure to allow more modern features to be implemented more easily and therefore more quickly. Fundamental changes always carry compatibility breaking changes. Thus, breaking as many as possible in one fell swoop would be best. And they try to help migrating projects from Godot 3 to 4 with a converter tool.  
Because changing the whole architecture of the engine takes a long time (it does for any project), there's time for many new features made by contributors, making Godot 4 also feature richer.
