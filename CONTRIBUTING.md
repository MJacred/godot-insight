# Making contributions going smoother


## First Step: check if your issue is not already opened

GitHub has some documentation on easier searching: https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests


## Reporting Errors in Statements

* state file path
* what inside is incorrect, grouped by header (aka (sub)chapter title)
* note Godot version, if the information validity changed
* if there is a correct statement as a replacement, please write one
  * and cite source, like Pull Requests, Commits or official documentation / tutorials, videos showcasing, etc.


## Contributing Pull Requests
