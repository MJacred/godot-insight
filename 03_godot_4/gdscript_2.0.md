Advantages
* no build times, instant run
* hot reload changes in the running game
* engine-specific features: Node path syntax, onready, connection visualization in IDE, preload keyword, etc.
* code autocomplete can complete game data (node paths, file paths, animation names in a player, live data in objects, etc).
* receives drop events from editor (node paths, file paths, properties, etc.)
* docs built-in in code editor and inspector
* [static typing](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/static_typing.html) (though it's optional)
* you extend GDScript with C#/C++

Disadvantages
* not strictly strongly typed

Should not be confused with UnityScript or Python.
