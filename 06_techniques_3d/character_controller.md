# Miscellaneous

Background Info
* With Bullet physics, the center of mass is the RigidBody3D center. With GodotPhysics, the center of mass is the average of the [CollisionShape3D] centers.

# Climbing Stairs - Shifty's Manifesto

If your character needs to be able to climb stairs, a capsule collider won't cut it [source](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/2751). A cylinder is preferred. See [Shifty's Godot Character Movement Manifesto](character_controller_by_shifty.md), who describes a solution for Godot 3.  
See implementation example for Godot 3.5: https://github.com/mrezai/GodotStairs

In Godot 4, in theory, use
* RigidBody3D
    * `set_lock_rotation_enabled(true)` OR
        * sets body mode to PhysicsServer3D::BODY_MODE_DYNAMIC_LINEAR
    * `set_freeze_enabled(true)` + `set_freeze_mode(FreezeMode.FREEZE_MODE_KINEMATIC)`
        * but ignores `lock_rotation`
* then call and use custom integrator
    * `set_use_custom_integrator(true)`
